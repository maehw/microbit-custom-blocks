I wanted to have multiple bar graphs at the same time, so I created it as a custom block.

* `singleVerticalBargraph_block.js` contains the block code
* `singleVerticalBargraph_test.js` contains the test/demo code: a simple sound power+energy meter
* `singleVerticalBargraph_test.js` is the precompiled test/demo code to be flashed on a BBC micro:bit
